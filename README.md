## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
My favorite applications are...
1. Twitter / X
2. Instagram
3. Notes

2. Features that make them my favorite app are Dark Mode and Deleting old messages.

3. App Idea: An improvement of Twitter which aims to provide users with a more immersive and personalized social media experience.
   In addition to the familiar features of tweeting and following,one key feature is the topic community which are curated spaces for users to explore specific areas of interest.
   Users can join these communities to connect with like-minded individuals, share expertise, and gain access to exclusive content.
